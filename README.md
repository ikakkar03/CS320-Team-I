WorldwiseEd is a comprehensive study abroad consultancy platform designed to streamline the application process for students and enhance efficiency for consultants. Our aim is to provide a platform for both students and consultants in which students can upload their documents, create a list of universities and colleges they are interested in, and prepare themselves before creating and submitting their official applications and the consultants observe the students progress and guide them accordingly.
We plan to use ReactJS for frontend, Node.js with Express for backend, PostgrSQL for databse, Firebase for authentication, Sendgrid for the email service and AWS for hosting.
